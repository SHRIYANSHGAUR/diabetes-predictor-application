# Diabetes Predictor Application ( WINNER 1ST PRIZE HACKOVERFLOW 5.0 N.I.T. DURGAPUR) 
## Predict Diabetes on the fly with a 85% accurate Machine-Learning model live on Internet.

# The problem Diabetes Predictor App solves
## The application solves the biggest concerns of all PATHOLOGY CENTERS that how to infer the test results without getting the COSTLY appointments with doctors . When a person gets his sugar test results he is completely OBLIVIOUS on how to infer whether he is DIABETIC OR NOT . from the data present in the TEST-Report which is full of MEDICAL-JARGONS. The applicaion that I have created can solve this isssue by bridging the Knowlegde gap, using KAGGLE -DATASET TRAINED POLYNOMIAL REGRESSION MACHINE LEARNING MODEL, which is available for use live on internet!

# What I did
## The #machinelearning model is based on Polynomial regression which I created using Scikit-learn which is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms. I took the data set from Kaggle , name of which is mentioned on front page of website. Its integrated using FLASK (python) backend which is hosted live on heroku server!

# Challenges I ran into
### Getting accurate dataset was a challenge- Using 100% dataset present on Kaggle solved that for me.
### Analysing data was difficult- Pandas, numpy, plotlib libraries of Pyhton helped me to analyse data and choose suitable model.
### Making MLmodel- Using polynomial regresssion model of sklearn helped me to set up POLYNOMIAL REGRESSSION model
### Training the model on test data set- Used sklearn library to divide test and train data in 20 / 80 ratio, for testing and training.
### Deploying the model-LIVE! -- used Heroku server to host application by intgrating the model into FLASK(pyhton) Backend.

# Future Scope:
## 1. Showing suggestions of leading better lifestyles if probability of being diabetic comes > 60.
## 2. Getting a bigger data set for training purpose of model so as to get above 95 % accuracy.
