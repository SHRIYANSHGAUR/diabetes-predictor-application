# Diabetes-predictor - 1ST PRIZE WINNER HACKOVERFLOW 5.0 N.I.T. DURGAPUR 
## Predict Diabetes on the fly with our 85% accurate Machine-Learning model live on Internet.
# The problem Diabetes Predictor App solves
## The application solves the biggest concerns of all PATHOLOGY CENTERS that how to infer the test results without getting the COSTLY appointments with doctors .When a person gets his sugar test results he is completely OBLIVIOUS on how to infer whether he is DIABETIC OR NOT . from the data present in the TEST-Report which is full of MEDICAL-JARGONS.The applicaion that I have created can solve this isssue by bridging the Knowlegde gap, using KAGGLE -DATASET TRAINED POLYNOMIAL REGRESSION MACHINE LEARNING MODEL, which is available for use live on internet!

# Challenges I ran into
## Getting accurate dataset was a challenge- Using 100% accurate dataset present on Kaggle solved that for me.
## Analysing data was difficult- Pandas, numpy, plotlib libraries of Pyhton helped me to analyse data and choose suitable model.
## Making MLmodel- Using polynomial regresssion model of sklearn helped me to set up POLYNOMIAL REGRESSSION model
## Training the model on test data set- Used sklearn library to divide test and train data in 20 / 80 ratio, for testing and training.
## Deploying the model-LIVE! -- used Heroku server to host application by intgrating the model into FLASK(pyhton) Backend.

# Technologies I used
## Flask
## Python
## Kaggle
## HTML/CSS/JavaScript
## sklearn
